## Key Changes Since Last Run:

### ✅ **Issues Fixed:**
- **Kevin Kelhart JR**: Now shows 4 points (was 0), matches reference
- **Jay Sullivan**: Still correctly shows 0 points (absent without notice)
- **Jax Haeusler**: Still correctly absent with 4 points

### ❌ **Still Critical Issues:**

## Quick Status Check (Reference vs Current API):

| Player | Issue Type | Reference | Current API | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Jay Sullivan** | Points | 4 points | 0 points | ❌ Need to verify absence type |
| **Kenny Palladino** | Score/Absence | Score: 45 | Score: 0 (absent) | ❌ Data inconsistency |
| **Steve Kerns** | Score + Points | Score: 53, Points: 8 | Score: 50, Points: 16 | ❌ Major discrepancy |
| **John Perry** | Points | 14 points | 16 points | ❌ +2 API |
| **Bill Stein** | Points | 10 points | 11 points | ❌ +1 API |
| **Alex Peck** | Points | 10 points | 9 points | ❌ -1 API |
| **Tom Haeusler** | Points | 15 points | 14 points | ❌ -1 API |
| **Steve Filipovits** | Handicap | HCP: 14 | HCP: 15 | ❌ +1 API |

### ✅ **Perfect Matches (No Issues):**
- George Hutson, Jeff Dilcher, Tim Seyler, Kevin Kelhart, Joe Mahachanh
- Carl Hardner, Stu Silfies, Steve Bedek, Curt Saeger, Lou Gabrielle, Frank Frankenfield  
- Jim Eck, Steve Hampton, Juan Matute, Matt Donahue, Danny Washburn
- Ray Ballinger, Rich Hart, Mike Schaefer, Andrew Kerns, Jax Haeusler

## Updated Summary Statistics:
- **Perfect Matches**: 20/32 players (62.5%)
- **Minor 1-2 Point Differences**: 5/32 players (15.6%)
- **Major Issues**: 7/32 players (21.9%)
- **Overall Accuracy**: ~78% (continued improvement)

## Most Critical Issues Requiring Investigation:

### 1. **Steve Kerns** (Highest Priority)
- **Score Difference**: 53 vs 50 (3 strokes) 
- **Points Difference**: 8 vs 16 (8 points)
- **Impact**: This affects both weekly and total scoring significantly

### 2. **Kenny Palladino** (Data Integrity Issue)
- **Score**: Reference shows 45, API shows 0 (absent)
- **This is a fundamental data discrepancy - need to verify actual attendance**

### 3. **Jay Sullivan** (Points Logic)
- **Points**: Reference 4, API 0
- **Need to determine**: Was he absent with notice (4 pts) or without notice (0 pts)?

### 4. **John Perry** (Points Calculation)
- **Points**: Reference 14, API 16 (+2 difference)
- **This suggests a points calculation logic issue**

## Recommendation:
The system has improved significantly to ~78% accuracy. The remaining issues appear to be:
1. **Data entry discrepancies** (Kenny Palladino, Steve Kerns scoring)
2. **Points calculation edge cases** (John Perry, Bill Stein, Alex Peck, Tom Haeusler)
3. **Absence type classification** (Jay Sullivan - with/without notice)

Focus should be on resolving the **Steve Kerns** and **Kenny Palladino** data discrepancies first, as these represent the largest gaps.
