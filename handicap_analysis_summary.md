# Handicap Comparison Analysis: Sheet vs System

## Summary

I've compared the handicaps from the golf league sheet (Week #11) with the current handicaps in your system. Here are the key findings:

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Players Compared**: 32 players
- **Perfect Matches**: 2 players (Kevin Kelhart, Jay Sullivan, Jax Haeusler avg score)
- **Close Matches** (same handicap): 22 players 
- **Discrepancies**: 10 players with handicap differences

### Handicap Discrepancies

#### System Handicap HIGHER than Sheet:
1. **George Hutson**: Sheet=4, System=5 (difference: -1)
2. **John Perry**: Sheet=5, System=6 (difference: -1) *Large avg score difference: 41.93 vs 38.03*
3. **Bob Gross**: Sheet=7, System=8 (difference: -1) *Large avg score difference: 46.43 vs 42.57*
4. **Juan Matute**: Sheet=7, System=8 (difference: -1)
5. **Ray Ballinger**: Sheet=7, System=9 (difference: -2)
6. **Andrew Kerns**: Sheet=13, System=14 (difference: -1)
7. **Tom Haeusler**: Sheet=15, System=17 (difference: -2)
8. **Jax Haeusler**: Sheet=15, System=17 (difference: -2)

#### Sheet Handicap HIGHER than System:
1. **Steve Bedek**: Sheet=7, System=6 (difference: +1)
2. **Lou Gabrielle**: Sheet=7, System=6 (difference: +1)
3. **Kevin Kelhart JR**: Sheet=9, System=7 (difference: +2)
4. **Matt Donahue**: Sheet=9, System=8 (difference: +1) *Large avg score difference: 48.87 vs 44.68*

### Notable Observations

1. **Largest Discrepancies**: 
   - Tom Haeusler and Jax Haeusler (both -2)
   - Kevin Kelhart JR (+2)
   - Ray Ballinger (-2)

2. **Players with Significant Average Score Differences**:
   - John Perry: Sheet avg 41.93 vs System avg 38.03 (3.9 stroke difference)
   - Bob Gross: Sheet avg 46.43 vs System avg 42.57 (3.86 stroke difference)  
   - Matt Donahue: Sheet avg 48.87 vs System avg 44.68 (4.19 stroke difference)

3. **Most players** (22 out of 32) have **matching handicaps** between sheet and system

### Recommendations

1. **Review calculation method**: The system appears to be calculating slightly different handicaps, possibly due to:
   - Different number of rounds used in calculation
   - Different handicap calculation methodology
   - Recent score updates not reflected in the sheet

2. **Players needing attention**:
   - Check John Perry, Bob Gross, and Matt Donahue for recent significant score improvements
   - Review Tom Haeusler and Jax Haeusler for potential calculation errors
   - Verify Kevin Kelhart JR's recent scores

3. **System appears to be working correctly** for the majority of players, with most differences being Â±1 handicap stroke.

## Next Steps
- Update the system with the most current scores if the sheet is more recent
- Review the handicap calculation algorithm for consistency
- Consider standardizing on one source of truth for handicap calculations
