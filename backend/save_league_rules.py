<h1>üèåÔ∏è Golf League Rules &amp; Scoring System</h1>

<h2>üìã Overview</h2>
<p>This golf league operates on a <strong>Match Play format</strong> using a <strong>Simple Average Handicap System</strong> for fair competition across all skill levels. The league emphasizes sportsmanship, consistency, and competitive play through a structured points-based system.</p>

<hr>

<h2>üèåÔ∏è Handicap System</h2>

<h3>Simple Average Handicap</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calculation Method</strong>: Player handicaps are calculated using a simple average of their gross scores from previous rounds</li>
<li><strong>Handicap Updates</strong>: Handicaps are recalculated weekly based on all completed rounds in the current season</li>
<li><strong>Initial Handicap</strong>: New players receive an estimated handicap based on their first few rounds</li>
<li><strong>Handicap Application</strong>: Handicaps are applied hole-by-hole using the course's stroke index (difficulty rating)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stroke Allocation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Strokes are given on holes based on the <strong>hole handicap</strong> (stroke index) from hardest (1) to easiest (9)</li>
<li>If a player's handicap is 9, they receive one stroke on the 9 most difficult holes</li>
<li>If handicap difference between players is 5, the higher-handicap player gets strokes on the 5 hardest holes</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>‚ö° Match Play Scoring System</h2>

<h3>Hole-by-Hole Scoring</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 Points</strong> awarded to the player with the lowest <strong>net score</strong> on each hole</li>
<li><strong>1 Point</strong> awarded to each player in case of a <strong>tie</strong> on any hole</li>
<li><strong>0 Points</strong> awarded to the player with the higher net score</li>
</ul>

<h3>Match Completion Bonus</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 Additional Points</strong> awarded to the player with the <strong>lowest total net score</strong> for the entire match</li>
<li>This bonus is awarded regardless of how many individual holes were won</li>
</ul>

<h3>Maximum Points Per Match</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>20 Points Maximum</strong>: 18 points possible from holes (2 √ó 9 holes) + 2 points for net score winner</li>
<li><strong>Typical Distribution</strong>: Most matches will see point totals between 8-12 points per player</li>
</ul>

<hr>
