# Mobile Score Entry Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the score entry interface to provide a better mobile experience while maintaining the existing desktop functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Responsive Layout**
- **Desktop**: Maintains the existing table layout for optimal screen real estate usage
- **Mobile**: Switches to a card-based layout that's touch-friendly and easier to navigate

### 2. **Card-Based Mobile Interface**
- Each matchup is displayed as an individual card
- Clear visual hierarchy with player names, scores, and actions
- Flight information and match status prominently displayed
- Better spacing for touch interactions

### 3. **Enhanced Score Entry**
- **Large input fields**: 48px height for easier touch targeting
- **Clear labels**: "Gross Score" labels for each input
- **Immediate feedback**: Visual indicators for changed scores
- **Absence handling**: Simple checkboxes to mark players as absent

### 4. **Improved Visual Design**
- **Match points prominently displayed**: Large, colored badges showing match play points
- **Status indicators**: Clear badges showing matchup status (Complete, Pending, etc.)
- **Player information**: Handicap and average score displayed for context
- **VS divider**: Clear separation between players

### 5. **Touch-Optimized Actions**
- **Larger buttons**: Full-width action buttons with icons and text
- **Clear hierarchy**: Primary actions (scorecard, save) more prominent
- **Better spacing**: Adequate touch targets (minimum 44px)

## Technical Implementation

### Layout Structure
```
Desktop (md:breakpoint and up):
- Table layout with columns for Matchup & Scores, Flight, Result, Actions

Mobile (below md:breakpoint):
- Card layout with sections for:
  - Header (Flight, Status)
  - Players (Name, Stats, Score Entry)
  - Actions (Scorecard, Save, Clear)
```

### Key Features
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Uses Tailwind's `md:` prefix for desktop-specific styles
- **Form validation**: Proper input handling with TypeScript type safety
- **State management**: Real-time updates to matchup changes
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and form associations

### CSS Enhancements
- **Mobile-specific animations**: Subtle scale effects on touch
- **Input styling**: Removed browser-specific number input controls
- **Card shadows**: Enhanced visual depth and feedback
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px height for interactive elements

## User Experience Benefits

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Swipe gestures**: Swipe to save or clear scores
